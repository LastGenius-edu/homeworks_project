## Project name: English_Literature_Analysis_Project

#[Finished site](http://lastgenius.pythonanywhere.com)
![](https://github.com/LastGenius-edu/homeworks_project/raw/master/docs/site.png)

## Description: 

The project aims to analyze a huge library of openly available Project Gutenberg classic English texts and find out:
* The specific changes that took places during the course of history and evolution of the English language
* The differences between the writings of different authors and especially the differences between male and female writers (word usage, the problems brought up)
* The causes of the specific changes

The results of this project include an interactive visualization of these changes, as well as word portraits of the specific authors, periods and books.

In order to ensure the quick response and search given the size and the number of the texts the efficient data structures would need to be used.
